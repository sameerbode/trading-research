## Strategy Rules

**Instrument:** GC (Gold Futures, CME)
**Data:** 1-minute Databento bars resampled to 3-minute
**Session:** All hours — CME Globex (no session filter)

### Entry
3-minute EMA34 crosses EMA50 in either direction.
- EMA34 crosses **above** EMA50 → **LONG**
- EMA34 crosses **below** EMA50 → **SHORT**

No additional entry filter applied in V1.0. Always in market — every cross flips the position.

### Exit
Opposite 3-minute EMA34/50 cross.

### Indicators (analysis only — not used as filters in V1.0)

```
BX = RSI( EMA(close, 5) - EMA(close, 20), 5 ) - 50
```

Oscillates around 0. Positive = bullish momentum, negative = bearish.

- **Daily BX** — calculated on CME session closes (5 PM CT open → 4 PM CT close). Each bar uses the prior completed session's BX. No lookahead.
- **Weekly BX** — same formula on weekly closes (week ending Friday 4 PM CT). Each bar uses the prior completed week's BX. No lookahead.
- **BX direction** — rising if current period BX > prior period BX.

Bucket labels:
- **D↑** = daily BX rising, **D↓** = daily BX falling
- **W↑** = weekly BX rising, **W↓** = weekly BX falling

## Quick Reference — When to Trade

Stats from 10-year backtest (Apr 2016 – Apr 2026). ✅ = take the trade · ❌ = skip

| Bucket | Long | Short |
|:---:|:---|:---|

> **Rule of thumb:** Weekly BX direction = trade direction. W↑ → longs only. W↓ → shorts only.
> Best setups are D↓/W↑ long and D↓/W↓ short — daily pulling back into the weekly trend.
> D↑/W↓ in either direction = skip entirely.

## What the 10-Year Data Confirms vs Challenges

### Confirmed
- **D↓/W↑ longs are the best bucket in both windows** — +13.80% over 7 months, +51.13% over 10 years. Consistent pullback-in-uptrend edge.
- **D↑/W↓ shorts are consistently the worst** — -2.53% over 7 months, -32.00% over 10 years. Shorting when daily is rising against weekly weakness destroys capital.
- **Weekly BX direction separates longs from shorts** — longs in W↑ generated +52.69% combined over 10 years vs -16.44% for shorts in W↑.

### Challenged
- **D↓/W↓ longs showed strength in 7 months (+0% roughly) but only +3.78% over 10 years** — marginal, not reliable.
- **D↑/W↓ longs looked weak in 7 months (+2.33%) but generated +23.49% over 10 years** — the secular gold bull run gave these long tailwind. Not structurally sound.
- **Overall PF dropped from 1.22 to 1.04 on 10 years** — the 7-month window was during an unusually strong directional period for GC. Not representative of average conditions.

## Decision Tree

```
Is Weekly BX rising (W↑)?
│
├── YES — W↑
│   │
│   ├── Is Daily BX falling (D↓)?
│   │   └── LONG on 3min EMA34/50 cross ← best setup (37.1% WR 7m / 29.9% WR 10y)
│   │
│   └── Is Daily BX rising (D↑)?
│       └── LONG on 3min EMA34/50 cross ← acceptable (27.7% WR 7m / 28.8% WR 10y)
│           (skip all shorts when W↑)
│
└── NO — W↓
    │
    ├── Is Daily BX falling (D↓)?
    │   └── SHORT on 3min EMA34/50 cross ← best short setup (35.5% WR 7m / 27.7% WR 10y)
    │
    └── Is Daily BX rising (D↑)?
        └── SKIP — worst bucket in both windows (18.2% WR 7m, -32.00% PnL 10y)

## Open Questions for V1.1

1. Does adding a hard stop (e.g. 15 pts) reduce avg loss without hurting win rate?
2. How do results hold on CL across the same periods?
3. What does the year-by-year PnL look like — are there losing years?
4. At 28% win rate, expect runs of 8-10 consecutive losses — what does position sizing look like?
5. Can PF reach ≥ 1.5 consistently before considering live trading?

## Notes

- V1.0 is a characterisation run — no filters applied, all crosses taken.
- Daily and weekly BX use proper CME session closes (5 PM CT → 4 PM CT), not calendar midnight.
- All BX values at entry use the prior completed session — no lookahead.
- Points (Avg Win / Avg Loss) are raw price points. For GC: 1 point = $100/contract.
- The 7-month window (Sep 2025 – Mar 2026) coincided with a strong GC bull run. 10-year results are more representative of average market conditions.
